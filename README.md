# CSC 430 Software Engineering - Lab5 DLL Business Object

Through the use of auto generated forms and ASP.NET, a simple gui was made to allow CRUD actions to be taken on a local database. 

There are a total of 5 forms used to display and manipulate the information in the database.

A DLL business object was used to store the object class structure used in the application.

A database init file is stored to allow initialization of the table used in the program.
